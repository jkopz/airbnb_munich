Being interested in the Munich housing market, I took it as an opportunity to investigate the apartment situation in the form of an Airbnb apartments analysis. </br>
</br>
Note that these numbers do not represent the normal rental cost of the properties in Munich, as Airbnb apartments and hotel rooms typically cost more than if you were renting the property, but they stil give a good insight into the housing market.

The dataset can be optained from [Inside Airbnb](http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html).
